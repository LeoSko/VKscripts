# VKscripts
My personal VK scripts for administration of groups. You can use them for free as long as you provide this repository link in source code.

### Birthdays
Looks through group's members and filters all people that has their birthdays around current date. Then sends you a message with the list of them using group or user token. Useful if you forget to write a post for congratulation for these people.
